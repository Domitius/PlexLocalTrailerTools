# PlexLocalTrailerTools
These are a couple of scripts that will assist the process of downloading trailers for your Plex movies. Created for <strong> Windows </strong>

<h3>youtube-dl should reside in your Videos folder.</h3>

<h2>getTrailer.bat</h2>
<p>This script is for downloading trailers for your Plex movies via youtube-dl.exe and youtube.com . 
I do not take ownership for youtube-dl.exe as I did not create the software. I downloaded it via GitHub way
before the project took form. So, credit goes to where it is deserved.</p>

<p>It asks for the desired movie folder in your Videos folder, and then asks for the url to the desired youtube video. It then works
it's magic and downloads the video into the newly created Trailers folder in your movie folder.</p>
